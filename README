This is your new Play application
=================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `activator dist`.

=================================

This is not the whole Play framework CRUD Implementation, I have only included Create and Finding parts in the application.
Assume that you are adding details of any particular person and then you want to find any person's details using
their resepective phone numbers.

Also phoneNumber is String here, not Integer and it's acting as a primary key .

For an instance if phoneNumber is : ddf , then you can try this url : http://localhost:9000/phone/ddf
and you will get this : [{"phone":"ddf","firstName":"gdfgdfgdfgd","lastName":"gdfgdfg","location":"gdgd"}]


==================================

Database : Mongodb, Morphia is being used for Mongo. Hope this small app will help you along the way in learning
and developing more complex applications in Play frameworks/ JAVA 8.
